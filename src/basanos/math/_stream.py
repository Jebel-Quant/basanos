"""Incremental (streaming) output types for BasanosStream.

This private module provides the :class:`StepResult` frozen dataclass, which
is the per-timestep output type of the ``BasanosStream`` incremental API.

class StepResult:
    """Frozen dataclass representing the output of a single ``BasanosStream`` step.

    Each call to ``BasanosStream.step()`` returns one ``StepResult`` capturing
    the optimised cash positions, the per-asset volatility estimate, the step
    date, and a status label that describes the solver outcome for that
    timestep.

    Attributes:
        date: The timestamp or date label for this step.  The type mirrors
            whatever is stored in the ``'date'`` column of the input prices
            DataFrame (typically a Python :class:`datetime.date`,
            :class:`datetime.datetime`, or a Polars temporal scalar).
        cash_position: Optimised cash-position vector, shape ``(N,)``.
            Entries are ``NaN`` for assets that are still in the EWMA warmup
            period or that are otherwise inactive at this step.
        status: Solver outcome label for this timestep.  One of:

            * ``'warmup'`` — fewer rows have been seen than the EWMA warmup
              requires; all positions are ``NaN``.
            * ``'zero_signal'`` — the expected-return signal vector ``mu`` is
              identically zero; positions are set to zero rather than solved.
            * ``'degenerate'`` — the covariance matrix is ill-conditioned or
              numerically singular; positions cannot be computed reliably and
              are returned as ``NaN``.
            * ``'valid'`` — normal operation; ``cash_position`` holds the
              optimised allocations.
        vola: Per-asset EWMA percentage-return volatility, shape ``(N,)``.
            Values are ``NaN`` during the warmup period before the EWMA has
            accumulated sufficient history.

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> result = StepResult(
        ...     date="2024-01-02",
        ...     cash_position=np.array([1000.0, -500.0]),
        ...     status="valid",
        ...     vola=np.array([0.012, 0.018]),
        ... )
        >>> result.status
        'valid'
        >>> result.cash_position.shape
        (2,)
